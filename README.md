# IndieWebPoll

*This project is a work in progress. It is not ready for use.*

IndieWebPoll is a polling web application powered by Webmention. IndieWebPoll lets you create a poll to which you can respond using Webmentions. IndieWebPoll comes with a HTML component you can embed into your website to show the results of your poll.

Optionally, you can use `indiewebpoll.js` to build your own polling on your website instead of relying on IndieWebPoll.
